# SMG1-Any-Starbit-Route-Generator
NOTE that you must have .NET Core Desktop Runtime 3.1.8 installed to run this. You can get that here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1

The point of this program is to create an optimal starbit route with any given SMG1 any% route!
To use, just open the exe file and follow the instructions :)

ALSO. Just so you know, I am very, very new to coding, so this was more of a for-fun thing than anything. Please do not make fun of my garbage programming, I am still learning.
I hope to improve this program as I get better.

# Formatting
This program reads the splits from a text file, so to use this program, create a new text file, and fill it with your route. Each line has a new split (or just copy from a Livesplit file). An example file is given.

When writing in the path, make sure it leads directly to your text file. (For example, "C:\Users\Claire\Desktop\Any% PushBackRoute.txt")

# Notes
Currently, the program overwrites the text in your text file, so be sure to back it up if you don't want to lose it.

If you notice any bugs or any places this can be improved, please tell me! I'm sure there's a ton of them both!
