# SMG1-Any-Starbit-Route-Generator
The point of this program is to create an optimal starbit route with any given SMG1 any% route!

ALSO. Just so you know, I am very, very new to coding, so this was more of a for-fun thing than anything. Please do not make fun of my garbage programming, I am still learning.
I hope to improve this program as I get better.

# Formatting
This program reads the splits from a text file, so to use this program, create a new text file, and fill it with your route. Each line has a new split (or just copy from a Livesplit file). An example file is given.

When writing in the path, make sure it leads directly to your text file. (For example, "C:\Users\Claire\Desktop\Any% PushBackRoute.txt")

# Notes
If the program just hangs, it means your route doesn't get enough starbits to feed one of the hungry lumas. This is most likely to happen in the early game. For instance, if your route includes Sling Pod early on.

If you notice any bugs or any places this can be improved, please tell me! I'm sure there's a ton of them both!
